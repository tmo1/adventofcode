# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles of various years. They are all written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3; all or almost all use only the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), and most import nothing except for [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html), for reading the puzzle input. Filenames of the form `nn.py` and `nnb.py` in directory `yyyy` are respectively solutions to the two parts of the puzzles of day `nn` of year `yyyy`.

## Running

Some of the solutions expect puzzle input in a particular file (specified in the script), while others expect it on standard input; some can be made executable and run as `~/nn.py < input`, while others can be run as `~python3 nn.py < input`. Some have comments at the top provding additional details or caveats for the particular solution. Most should finish within [15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about); those that do not should have this noted in the comments.
